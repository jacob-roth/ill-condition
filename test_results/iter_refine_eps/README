Each matrix stored in this folder is Ab, that is b (stored as a column vector) appended onto A.
To extract:

Ab = np.load('m5.npy', 'r')
A = Ab[:, :-1]
b = Ab[:, -1]

All A in this folder have:

	Condition number 	1000
	Dimensions		100 x 100

while b of course has dimensions 100 x 1.

Some of these (A,b) blew up my iterative refinement/continuation algorithm (in dir 'blows_up'), 
but others caused it to converge just fine (in dir 'converges').

See test_solvers.gather_IR_data for the code that generates these matrices.
